⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ The saying you're referring to is often expressed as "Love yourself first, and then you can truly love someone else." This sentiment emphasizes the importance of self-love and self-acceptance as a foundation for healthy relationships with others. When you have a positive relationship with yourself, including self-respect, self-compassion, and self-confidence, you're better equipped to engage in meaningful and fulfilling connections with others. Loving oneself involves recognizing and accepting one's own strengths and weaknesses, setting boundaries, practicing self-care, and prioritizing personal growth and well-being. By nurturing a healthy relationship with yourself, you can approach relationships with others from a place of authenticity, empathy, and genuine affection.
